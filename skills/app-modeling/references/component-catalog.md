# Component Catalog

Maps common application components to Radius resource types, with detection cues from source code (client libraries across npm / PyPI / NuGet / RubyGems, plus manifest and connection-string hints). Use this to turn the selected deployment profile and its pinned source support into types to emit. Always verify the type against the exact configured extension, registered schema, and Environment recipe.

Match by **wire protocol, not only a library or type name**: MariaDB clients can map to MySQL, Valkey to Redis, and DocumentDB / Cosmos DB's Mongo API to MongoDB only when protocol versions and authentication modes are compatible. A concrete recipe may back an abstract messaging type with Event Hubs, Service Bus, or another managed service; verify that the application client supports the actual endpoint, TLS, and authentication contract.

## Profile-aware detection

- An explicit compatible request for a Radius type selects that source-supported backend or feature even when it is optional or not the application's default.
- Confirm the pinned source has the adapter/client and exact configuration path. Do not emit a requested type merely because the repository mentions it in unrelated tests or examples.
- Without an explicit profile, prefer a complete documented runtime manifest/configuration. Do not promote an optional dependency solely because a package is installed.
- Every selected type must be used by a modeled workload's primary feature. A declared but unwired resource is not a detected component.
- Do not infer public ingress from an HTTP listener, exposed port, health endpoint, or web UI alone. Emit `Radius.Compute/routes` only when the selected profile explicitly needs an externally reachable URL and the target Environment has a compatible route recipe.
- Do not enable optional application features, such as dynamic configuration, merely because source supports them. Include their settings and storage only when the selected profile requires that feature.

## Compute

| Component | Detection cues | Radius type |
|---|---|---|
| Long-running service / worker / job | app entry point; executable service in Dockerfile/compose; actual lifecycle | `Radius.Compute/containers` |
| Build image from source | complete practical Dockerfile/build context; no preferable published image | `Radius.Compute/containerImages` |
| External ingress | HTTP server with a verified listener that needs a public URL | `Radius.Compute/routes` |
| Persistent volume | source writes durable data; compose volume; writable path and access mode | `Radius.Compute/persistentVolumes` |

## Backing services (Radius type available)

| RabbitMQ / AMQP queue | `amqplib` / `pika`, `aio-pika` / `RabbitMQ.Client` / `bunny`; AMQP adapter/config selected by the profile | `Radius.Messaging/rabbitMQ` | Microservices, Enterprise |
| LLM inference | `openai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `@google/generative-ai` / `openai`, `anthropic` / `Azure.AI.OpenAI`; proxy/provider config selected by the profile | `Radius.AI/models` | Web App, Microservices, AI/ML |
| Full-text / AI search | `@elastic/elasticsearch`, `@opensearch-project/opensearch` / `elasticsearch`, `opensearch-py` / `Azure.Search.Documents` | `Radius.AI/search` | Web App, Microservices, Data Pipeline, AI/ML |
| Object storage (S3 / Blob / GCS) | SDK dependency, filesystem/backend adapter, compose/Helm config, or explicit compatible profile selecting remote object storage | `Radius.Storage/objectStorage` | Web App, Data Pipeline, AI/ML |
| App secrets (API keys, tokens); DB creds when the schema uses `secretName` | env-injected secrets; API keys in config | `Radius.Security/secrets` | supporting |

### Managed Kafka

Selecting `Radius.Messaging/kafka` does not close the workload connection. Before emitting Kafka client settings, inspect the concrete recipe and prove the complete endpoint, port, transport security, authentication mechanism, identity, managed-secret path/key, and app-native config syntax. Never assign a bare `properties.host` output directly to a bootstrap-server setting unless the recipe proves it is already a complete `host:port` value.

For the Azure Event Hubs recipe whose outputs are a namespace `host` plus managed `secrets.connectionString`, the Kafka client tuple is the Event Hubs FQDN on port 9093, `SASL_SSL`, `PLAIN`, username `$ConnectionString`, and the full connection string as the password. Bind that password from the declared managed secret with `secretKeyRef` and compose the final JAAS value at container runtime. Re-resolve these fields against the exact recipe revision rather than assuming this Azure shape for every Kafka recipe. See [managed-kafka-example.md](managed-kafka-example.md).

Do not replace this managed profile with a plaintext Kafka compose example when a floating extension lacks the recipe's managed-secret shape. That is extension drift, not a compatible fallback.

## Recognized but no Radius type yet

When present, include these in your summary and **report the gap** — do NOT substitute an unrelated type. Emit the supported components; if the missing piece is essential, ask the user how to proceed.

| Component | Detection cues | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Serverless functions | AWS Lambda / Azure Functions / GCP Functions handlers | No type yet |
| Generic message queue | `bullmq`, `celery`, `sidekiq`, SQS / Service Bus SDKs | Use Kafka/RabbitMQ if that is the actual broker; otherwise no type |
| MQTT / Mosquitto | `mqtt`, `paho-mqtt` | No type yet (blocks full IoT) |
| NATS | `nats` | No type yet |
| Oracle | `oracledb`, `cx_Oracle` | No type yet |
| Cassandra | `cassandra-driver` | No type yet |
| InfluxDB | `@influxdata/influxdb-client`, `influxdb-client` | No type yet |
| Memcached | `memcached`, `pymemcache` | No type yet |
| Vector DB (pgvector, Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate) | `pgvector`, `@qdrant/js-client`, `pinecone-client` | Use `Radius.Data/postgreSqlDatabases` for pgvector storage; vector features not modeled |
| Vault | `node-vault`, `hvac` | Use `Radius.Security/secrets` for app secrets; no Vault connection type |
