# Bicep Structure Rules

These rules apply to all generated `app.bicep` files. Resolve property names and types from the exact extension configured by the target repository and the matching registered schema/recipe contract. This file covers structural patterns only.

## General

- `extension radius` is the only extension line and comes first (it provides every Radius type; no per-namespace or per-type extensions)
- `param environment string` always declared
- A `@secure()` parameter is declared for each developer-supplied secret
- Exactly ONE `Radius.Core/applications@2025-08-01-preview` resource
- The `@<apiVersion>` shown in the examples below (e.g. `2025-08-01-preview`) is illustrative — use the API version from each type's schema
- All output files go in `.radius/` directory
- Compile with the repository's exact configured extension and resolve unknown type/property warnings before returning
- Emit every exact type, workload role, native key/value, secret binding, and relationship required by the selected compatible deployment profile

## Radius.Compute/containers structure

```bicep
resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
  name: 'my-container'
  properties: {
    environment: environment
    application: app.id
    containers: {                     // object map, NOT array
      myapp: {                        // key = container name (camelCase)
        image: myImage.properties.imageReference
        ports: {                      // object map, NOT array
          web: {
            containerPort: 3000       // NOT "port"
          }
        }
        env: {                        // exact app-native variable names
          MY_VAR: {
            value: 'some-value'       // must use { value: '...' } syntax
          }
          SECRET_VAR: {               // bind a secret by reference
            valueFrom: {
              secretKeyRef: {
                secretName: runtimeSecret.name
                key: 'password'
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    connections: {                    // optional TOP-LEVEL relationship map
      mysqldb: {                     // object map, NOT array
        source: mysqlDb.id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:
- `containers` is an object map, NOT an array
- `ports` is an object map, NOT an array
- `connections` is an object map, NOT an array
- `connections` is a TOP-LEVEL property under `properties` — NOT inside `containers`
- `disableDefaultEnvVars` goes on the connection entry, NOT on the container
- Port property is `containerPort`, NOT `port`
- `env` values use `{ value: 'string' }` for literals, or `{ valueFrom: { secretKeyRef: { secretName: ..., key: ... } } }` to bind a secret
- `containerPort` exposes the process port; it does not configure the process listener
- `command` replaces the image `ENTRYPOINT`, and `args` replaces `CMD`; override only after inspecting the image contract and required binaries
- Never **set** a read-only property. Referencing a read-only output is valid only when the exact schema exposes it and the configured recipe populates it
- A direct resource output, image, or secret reference creates dependency ordering; `connections` is not mandatory for ordering
- Include every co-scheduled role required by the selected profile in the `containers` map. A producer, consumer, proxy, worker, or sidecar must have its own complete image/process/configuration entry
- A startup-generated config file is valid only when the pinned image contains the shell/tools, the destination is writable, interpolation is safe, and the process is explicitly launched with that file

### Config file delivery

Prefer a complete config already included by the source build. When an unmodified image needs an external config file and the exact schemas support it, a mounted `Radius.Security/secrets` resource avoids assuming the image has a shell:

```bicep
resource runtimeConfig 'Radius.Security/secrets@2025-08-01-preview' = {
  name: 'runtime-config'
  properties: {
    environment: environment
    application: app.id
    data: {
      'app.yaml': {
        value: '''
<complete source-supported configuration>
'''
      }
    }
  }
}

resource workload 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
  name: 'workload'
  properties: {
    environment: environment
    application: app.id
    containers: {
      app: {
        image: '<pinned-image>'
        args: ['--config', '/etc/app/app.yaml']
        volumeMounts: [
          {
            volumeName: 'config'
            mountPath: '/etc/app'
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    volumes: {
      config: {
        secretName: runtimeConfig.name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Confirm the mounted filename, process argument, and secret/container schemas at the configured versions. Keep credentials out of the file when it can reference environment variables; bind those variables separately with `secretKeyRef`. Use startup generation only when mounting cannot satisfy the source contract and the image's shell, tools, writable path, expansion, and final command are all verified.

## Radius.Compute/containerImages structure

```bicep
resource myImage 'Radius.Compute/containerImages@2025-08-01-preview' = {
  name: 'myapp-image'
  properties: {
    environment: environment
    application: app.id
    tag: 'v1.2.3'   // pin to a commit SHA or immutable tag; omit for a content-addressable digest
    build: {
      source: 'git::https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git//<subdir>?ref=<sha-or-tag>'
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:
- The image is BUILT from `build.source` — there is NO `image` property and NO `param image string`
- `build.source` is the repo git URL: `git::https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git//<subdir>?ref=<sha-or-tag>`. Omit `//<subdir>` when the build context is the repo root; pin `?ref=` to a commit SHA or release tag for reproducible builds
- Optional `build.dockerfile` (path to the Dockerfile relative to the source; defaults to `Dockerfile`) and optional `build.platforms`
- `tag` is optional — pin it to a SHA/immutable tag, otherwise the recipe computes a content-addressable digest
- The container references the built image via `<serviceName>Image.properties.imageReference`; this reference creates the dependency edge, so NO separate connection to the image is needed
- Use `containerImages` only when the source includes a complete, practical Dockerfile and build context. Do not invent a wrapper build merely to avoid a maintained published image
- Registry credentials used to push a generated image are distinct from Kubernetes credentials used to pull it at runtime

## Radius.Data/* structure

```bicep
resource mysqlDb 'Radius.Data/mySqlDatabases@2025-08-01-preview' = {
  name: 'mysql'
  properties: {
    environment: environment
    application: app.id
    database: 'todos'      // derived from source (e.g. MYSQL_DATABASE)
    version: '8.0'         // derived from source (e.g. image tag mysql:8.0)
    username: 'myadmin'    // administrator you author for the provisioned DB
    password: password     // from a @secure() param
  }
}
```

Rules:
- Credentials follow whatever the type's schema defines (do not assume by engine):
  - schema has `username` + `password`: set them on the resource (`password` from a `@secure() param`, marked `x-radius-sensitive`)
  - schema has `secretName`: create a `Radius.Security/secrets` and reference it (see below)
  - schema has neither: do not invent credentials; inspect the recipe outputs and application auth requirements
- Symbolic name is engine/instance-derived (`mysqlDb`), NOT fixed — so multiple data stores never collide
- Developer-facing props (`database`, `version`, `size`, `topic`, `queue`, `container`) are derived from source — do NOT hardcode; only set properties the schema defines
- Do NOT set readOnly properties (`host`, `port`, `connectionString`) — these are recipe outputs
- A nonsecret read-only output such as `host`, `port`, or `endpoint` may be referenced for app-native wiring only when the exact schema and recipe expose it
- Resolve sensitive outputs from the exact schema and recipe. If that version exposes managed-secret metadata, bind its declared name/key directly through `valueFrom.secretKeyRef`; never copy the value into an authored secret or guess a sibling convenience property. Do not assume one universal `properties.secrets` shape. See [secrets-handling.md](secrets-handling.md)
- A selected resource is incomplete until a workload's primary feature consumes its exact subresource, endpoint, protocol/TLS/auth settings, and secret contract

## Radius.Security/secrets structure

```bicep
@secure()
param password string

resource dbSecret 'Radius.Security/secrets@2025-08-01-preview' = {
  name: 'db-secret'
  properties: {
    environment: environment
    application: app.id
    data: {
      USERNAME: {
        value: 'myadmin'
      }
      PASSWORD: {
        value: password
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:
- Use only when the exact schema supports it: for a type's required secret input, app secrets/config files, or a secure runtime binding for a developer-supplied credential
- Do not re-author a recipe-generated output. Bind directly from its schema-declared managed secret, or report that the exact contract cannot supply it
- Never set authored secret `data.value` from a recipe resource's sensitive output or a guessed convenience property
- NEVER hardcode passwords — use `@secure() param`
- `data` is an object map, NOT an array
- Keys in `data` must match their exact consumer or schema contract; do not impose universal casing
- `USERNAME` is the database administrator you author (e.g. `myadmin`) — it is not derived from the source
- `@secure()` does not make a downstream plain `env.value` secret; prefer a supported secret resource plus `secretKeyRef`

## Radius.Compute/routes structure

```bicep
resource myRoute 'Radius.Compute/routes@2025-08-01-preview' = {
  name: 'my-route'
  properties: {
    environment: environment
    application: app.id
    rules: [
      {
        matches: [
          { httpPath: '/' }
        ]
        destinationContainer: {
          resourceId: myContainer.id
          containerName: 'myapp'
          containerPort: 3000
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Rules:
- Do NOT use `target`, `source`, `destination`, or `backend` — these do NOT exist
- `rules` is the ONLY valid structure — array of objects with `matches` and `destinationContainer`
- `destinationContainer` requires ALL THREE: `resourceId`, `containerName`, `containerPort`
- Only add routes if external ingress is needed

## Image resolution

1. If the repo publishes a suitable image, use an immutable digest or pinned release tag directly.
2. Otherwise, if a complete practical Dockerfile and build context exist, use `Radius.Compute/containerImages` with an immutable `build.source` ref.
3. If neither path is viable, report the packaging gap instead of using a bare runtime base image or inventing a fragile build wrapper.

Do not use branch refs or `latest` when an immutable commit, tag, or digest is available.
A digest proves only the exact registry/repository manifest from which it was resolved. Never attach a digest discovered from one registry or mirror to an image name in another registry. If the digest cannot be verified against the selected image repository, use that repository's immutable release tag and report the remaining tag mutability instead.

## Runtime semantics

- Infer the listener address and port from the process/configuration, not only `EXPOSE`, compose mappings, or health checks.
- Model web, worker, producer, consumer, init, and one-shot roles according to their actual lifecycle.
- Preserve image entrypoint behavior unless a required override is verified. Confirm any shell, templating command, or helper binary exists in the image.
- Model writable and persistent paths with the ownership and access mode required by the process.
- Preserve exact required provider literals and nested configuration keys from an explicit compatible profile. A complete FQDN, TLS/SASL/encryption setting, model alias, or config-file stanza is application runtime wiring, not provider provisioning.
- Do not return an idle default, placeholder config, or UI-only process when the selected profile requires a functioning model route, remote storage backend, database connection, or message pipeline.
- Follow [runtime-contract.md](runtime-contract.md) for the full consistency pass.

## Application/provider boundary

`app.bicep` expresses developer intent and app-facing runtime values. Environment/provider Bicep owns recipe modules, cloud SKUs, regions, quota, network/firewall configuration, and output mapping. Keep provider implementation out of the app model unless the application itself must consume a provider-specific runtime value.

## Properties that do NOT exist

These are commonly hallucinated. They will cause deployment errors:

| Resource Type | Invalid property |
|---|---|
| `Radius.Compute/containers` | `port` (use `containerPort`), `image` at top level |
| `Radius.Compute/routes` | `target`, `source`, `destination`, `backend` |

## Output rules

- Do NOT include comments explaining skill rules in generated Bicep
- Do NOT set readOnly properties
- Reference read-only outputs only when the exact schema and recipe expose the value needed by the application
- Do NOT add `@description` decorators unless the user asks for them
