# Radius Application Modeling

Use this skill to generate a Radius application definition (`app.bicep`) from a source code repository.

## Response

When asked to model a repository:

1. Generate the application definition and write both `.radius/app.bicep` and `.radius/bicepconfig.json` (see [bicepconfig.json](#bicepconfigjson)) to the current working branch of the target repository.
2. Commit and push both files only after the exact target extension compiles the model and the validation checklist passes. If a newly generated floating extension lags the proven target contract, leave the exact-contract files as an uncommitted draft, report the validation blocker, and do not offer a pull request.
3. In your chat reply, give a one-line intro naming the app (e.g. "I'll create an application definition for `todo-list-app`."), then a short, natural summary of the resources you identified — a brief list such as "Container: `todo-list-app`", "MySQL database", "Secret for DB credentials". A sentence or two of reasoning is fine; don't dump raw source analysis or the full file contents.
4. Then ask whether to open a pull request against the default branch.

Don't open the pull request automatically — wait for the user to confirm. If they confirm, open a PR from the working branch against the default branch with title `Add Radius application definition` and body `Add .radius/app.bicep and .radius/bicepconfig.json for <app-name>.`

## Workflow

Before writing the Bicep:

1. Select one runnable deployment profile. Treat explicit user or scenario requirements for Radius types, workload roles/count, native configuration keys, secret bindings, provider profile, protocol values, and connection names as acceptance criteria. Verify that the pinned source supports that profile; do not silently replace it with an easier default or optional backend.
2. Build an internal requirement ledger that maps every acceptance criterion and planned resource property reference to source evidence, an exact Radius schema/recipe field, and the workload setting that consumes it. Use it for reasoning and validation; do not print it or add it as Bicep comments. Follow [runtime-contract.md](references/runtime-contract.md).
3. Inventory every executable workload and backing service in the selected profile from manifests, Dockerfiles, compose/Helm files, entrypoints, source configuration reads, client initialization, and referenced config files. Treat web, worker, producer, consumer, migration, scheduler, and sidecar roles separately.
4. Extract each workload's runtime contract: image/build context, entrypoint and arguments, listener and ports, required environment/configuration, secrets, writable storage, dependencies, wire protocols, and feature-critical configuration.
5. Map every selected backing service to a Radius type with [component-catalog.md](references/component-catalog.md), using [architecture-patterns.md](references/architecture-patterns.md) only as context. Report unsupported essential components instead of substituting unrelated types.
6. Resolve the target Environment's exact schema and recipe/output contract before creating or updating `.radius/bicepconfig.json` (see [bicepconfig.json](#bicepconfigjson)). Use any `bicepconfig.json` currently applicable to `.radius/app.bicep` as input, then make `.radius/bicepconfig.json` resolve the matching Radius extension. Record every emitted property path, recipe output mapping, and managed-secret key verbatim in the ledger. Reject an absent path instead of guessing an alias, convenience property, or wrapper. A mutable default config that this skill just created is a validator, not permission to change the selected deployment profile: if `radius:latest` lags the proven target schema/recipe, preserve the exact-contract model, report the extension drift and blocked local compilation, and require compilation with the target extension. Never weaken managed TLS/auth/secret wiring or fall back to an unrelated source default merely to make the floating extension compile.
7. Choose a source build only when the repository has a complete, practical build context. Otherwise use a pinned published image. Map every runtime value using [connection-conventions.md](references/connection-conventions.md), [secrets-handling.md](references/secrets-handling.md), and [bicep-structure-rules.md](references/bicep-structure-rules.md).
8. Generate the Bicep using [naming-conventions.md](references/naming-conventions.md), then compile it with the exact target extension. Treat unknown type/property warnings as unresolved schema mismatches. If only a newly generated floating alias is available and it lags the proven target contract, retain the exact-contract files solely as an uncommitted draft and stop before publication; do not alter the model to obtain a misleading clean compile.
9. Perform the [validation checklist](#validation-checklist) and close every item in the requirement ledger. Compilation or process startup alone is not success.

## Deployment Profile and Acceptance Contract

- **Explicit profile wins:** If the request names a supported Radius type, provider profile, workload role, native key, protocol value, secret binding, or relationship, model it exactly when the pinned source supports it. A source default or another valid deployment profile does not satisfy that request.
- **Source compatibility is still mandatory:** Resolve behavior from the requested commit/tag, not a different release or the current default branch. If an acceptance criterion conflicts with that source revision, stop and report the conflict instead of inventing compatibility.
- **No implicit omissions:** Each required typed resource must be emitted and wired to a consumer. Each required workload role must have a runnable process and complete config. Each required native key/value must appear in the exact source-supported location and format.
- **No decorative wiring:** Environment variables, connections, and resources must be consumed by the selected feature path. Merely declaring a dependency or starting a process does not prove the requested database, model, storage, or messaging path works.
- **Infer only when unspecified:** Without an explicit profile, prefer a complete, documented manifest/configuration that exercises the application's primary feature. If multiple materially different profiles remain valid, ask the user rather than choosing an optional backend arbitrarily.
- **Fail closed on verified incompatibility:** Fully implement every clearly supported criterion. Stop only after evidence proves the pinned source or exact schema/recipe cannot satisfy a requirement; do not return a partial definition as deployable or leave unresolved runtime caveats. A newly generated floating extension that lags the proven target contract is a validation blocker, not evidence that the target profile is incompatible.

### Repairing an existing app.bicep

When a deploy fails because of a modeling or schema error in an existing `.radius/app.bicep` (unknown type or API version, unknown or missing property, invalid reference between resources, wrong credential shape, or a Bicep parse or compile error), repair the file in place instead of regenerating it. This assumes the deploy error and any relevant logs have been provided; if they haven't, ask for them before attempting a fix.

1. Confirm whether the failure comes from the application model. If it is an infrastructure, recipe, Environment, or cluster failure (for example, recipe download/execution or provider provisioning), stop and report that editing `app.bicep` will not fix it. A pod that never becomes ready is not enough to classify the failure: inspect events and logs to distinguish infrastructure/connectivity failures from incorrect workload configuration, listeners, credentials, or dependency wiring in `app.bicep`.
2. Locate the implicated resource, property, or workload setting, then re-resolve the exact configured type schema and recipe output contract (see [Resource Type Resolution](#resource-type-resolution)) to confirm property names, required fields, credential shape, API version, and resource reference paths.
3. Apply the fix using the same runtime-contract, naming, structure, and secrets rules as authoring so the repaired resource stays consistent with the rest of the file. While you are in the file, also correct any other clear schema or rule violations you notice, and report each collateral fix you made.
4. Re-run the [validation checklist](#validation-checklist) against the whole file; a change in one resource can ripple to connections or references elsewhere.
5. Return the corrected file with a short note of what changed and why, then suggest redeploying to confirm the fix. If the same error recurs, treat the previous fix as insufficient and try a different fix rather than reapplying the one that just failed. If a couple of different fixes still do not resolve it, or no different fix can be found, stop and surface the problem to the user instead of looping.

## Deterministic Naming Rules

These rules eliminate ambiguity. Apply them exactly.

Explicit profile-required resource, relationship, and app-native configuration names take precedence over the default naming rules below. Never normalize a name the selected runtime contract requires verbatim.

### Symbolic names (left side of `=` in Bicep)

| Resource | Symbolic name |
|---|---|
| Application | `<shortName>App` where `<shortName>` is the app name without hyphens, camelCase (e.g., `todo-list-app` → `todoApp`) |
| Container | `<serviceName>Container` — service short name camelCase; single-container apps use `<shortName>Container` (e.g., `todoContainer`) |
| Container image | `<serviceName>Image` (e.g., `todoImage`) |
| Data store (database/cache/queue) | `<engine>` + role suffix, camelCase: `mysqlDb`, `postgresDb`, `neo4jDb`, `redisCache`. Multiple of the same engine: prefix with the source store name (e.g., `ordersPostgresDb`) |
| Data store secret | `<engine>Secret` when the type requires `secretName`; `<engine>RuntimeSecret` when the app must consume a supplied credential via `secretKeyRef`; app secrets use `appSecrets` |
| Route | `<serviceName>Route` (e.g., `todoRoute`) |

### Resource `name` properties (string values in Bicep)

| Resource | Name value |
|---|---|
| Application | Repository name in kebab-case (e.g., `'todo-list-app'`) |
| Container | Service name in kebab-case; single-container apps use the app name (e.g., `'todo-list-app'`) |
| Container image | `'<service-name>-image'` (e.g., `'todo-list-app-image'`) |
| Data store | Engine short name in kebab-case (`'mysql'`, `'postgres'`, `'neo4j'`, `'redis'`); multiple of the same engine use the source store name |
| Data store secret | `'<engine>-secret'` or `'<engine>-runtime-secret'`; app secrets `'app-secrets'` |

### Connection keys

| Connection | Key |
|---|---|
| Data store | Engine + role, lowercase: `mysqldb`, `postgresdb`, `neo4jdb`, `rediscache`. Multiple of the same engine: prefix with the source store name |

### Other fixed values

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Data store admin username | The administrator username you author for the provisioned database. Set it wherever the schema puts credentials — `username` on the resource, or `USERNAME` in the secret when the schema uses `secretName`. Use a simple admin name (e.g., `myadmin`); it is NOT derived from the source |
| Data store `database` name | Derived from source (e.g., `MYSQL_DATABASE`/`POSTGRES_DB`, or the database segment of a connection string) |
| Data store `version` | Derived from source (e.g., the image tag `mysql:8.0` → `'8.0'`) |
| Container key in `containers` map | Service short name camelCase (single-container: derived from app, e.g., `todo`) |
| Port key in `ports` map | `web` for the primary HTTP port; additional ports derive from protocol/use (`http`, `grpc`) |
| `build.source` for containerImages | Repo git URL: `git::https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git//<subdir>?ref=<sha-or-tag>` (`//<subdir>` only when the Dockerfile isn't at the repo root) |

## Resource Type Resolution

### Built-in types (from `radius-project/radius`)

| Need | Resource Type | API Version |
|---|---|---|
| Application grouping | `Radius.Core/applications` | `2025-08-01-preview` |

`Radius.Core/applications` is built into the `radius` extension — there is no schema file for it in `resource-types-contrib`. Do NOT use `Applications.Core/applications` — the model has moved to `Radius.Core/applications`.

### Extensible types (from `radius-project/resource-types-contrib`)

First inspect the target repository's `bicepconfig.json` and the target Environment: an existing pinned `radius` alias is the compile-time contract, while the Environment's registered type and recipe are the deployment contract. Resolve schemas from the `resource-types-contrib` revision that produced the artifact or registered definition. A mutable artifact such as `radius:latest`, a recipe tagged `latest`, or a branch ref can drift; warn about that uncertainty and do not mix property shapes from different revisions. If the skill itself must create the default floating alias and it lags the otherwise proven target contract, keep the target-contract model and report that exact-target compilation is still required; do not rewrite runtime wiring to match the stale alias.

Use the `radius-project/resource-types-contrib` repository for discovery. Do NOT hardcode a file path — derive it from the resource type name using the repo convention:

- Category = the segment after `Radius.` in the namespace (`Radius.Compute` → `Compute`, `Radius.Data` → `Data`, `Radius.Messaging` → `Messaging`, `Radius.AI` → `AI`, `Radius.Storage` → `Storage`, `Radius.Security` → `Security`)
- Schema path = `<Category>/<typeName>/<typeName>.yaml` (e.g., `Radius.Data/mySqlDatabases` → `Data/mySqlDatabases/mySqlDatabases.yaml`)

Read the matching schema file for property names, types, sensitivity, read-only outputs, and API versions. The configured extension and type registered in the target Environment must agree before publication. On a version mismatch, retain a proven exact-target model only as an uncommitted draft, report the blocker, and stop rather than choosing one contract or guessing.

The following is the COMPLETE allow-list of types this skill may emit:

| Need | Resource Type |
|---|---|
| Container images (build from Dockerfile) | `Radius.Compute/containerImages` |
| Containers | `Radius.Compute/containers` |
| MySQL | `Radius.Data/mySqlDatabases` |
| PostgreSQL | `Radius.Data/postgreSqlDatabases` |
| Neo4j | `Radius.Data/neo4jDatabases` |
| MongoDB | `Radius.Data/mongoDatabases` |
| Redis (cache) | `Radius.Data/redisCaches` |
| SQL Server | `Radius.Data/sqlServerDatabases` |
| Kafka (event streaming) | `Radius.Messaging/kafka` |
| RabbitMQ (message queue) | `Radius.Messaging/rabbitMQ` |
| AI model endpoint | `Radius.AI/models` |
| AI search | `Radius.AI/search` |
| Object storage | `Radius.Storage/objectStorage` |
| Persistent storage | `Radius.Compute/persistentVolumes` |
| External ingress | `Radius.Compute/routes` |
| Secrets | `Radius.Security/secrets` |

Do NOT use any type not listed above. Do NOT invent properties.

## Extension

Declare exactly one extension, `extension radius`. It provides every Radius type (`Radius.Core/*`, `Radius.Compute/*`, `Radius.Data/*`, `Radius.Messaging/*`, `Radius.AI/*`, `Radius.Storage/*`, `Radius.Security/*`). Do NOT declare per-namespace or per-type extensions (`radiusCompute`, `containers`, `kafka`, etc.). The `radius` alias must resolve through `.radius/bicepconfig.json`, which the skill always creates or updates (see [bicepconfig.json](#bicepconfigjson)); only ever write that file, never a config outside `.radius/`.

## bicepconfig.json

`app.bicep` cannot compile or deploy unless a `bicepconfig.json` resolves the `radius` extension. Always create or update `.radius/bicepconfig.json` (co-located with `.radius/app.bicep`) so it fits the generated `app.bicep`; only ever write that file, never a `bicepconfig.json` outside `.radius/`.

- If `.radius/bicepconfig.json` already exists, update it to fit `app.bicep`: add or correct what `app.bicep` needs (the `radius` extension reference and `extensibility`), preserve unrelated existing settings, and change or remove entries only where they conflict with what `app.bicep` needs. An already-correct file produces an empty diff.
- If it does not exist, create it. When a `bicepconfig.json` in a parent directory would otherwise be the config discovered for `.radius/app.bicep` (before you write `.radius/bicepconfig.json`), use it as input: seed the new file from its compatible settings and adjust so it fits `app.bicep` (add, correct, or drop entries as needed). Do not modify the parent file.
- When there is nothing to carry forward, create `.radius/bicepconfig.json` with:

```json
{
  "experimentalFeaturesEnabled": {
    "extensibility": true
  },
  "extensions": {
    "radius": "br:biceptypes.azurecr.io/radius:latest"
  }
}
```

Default to the `radius:latest` tag. Pin an immutable reference only when a specific version is provided (by an existing `bicepconfig.json`, the user, or the target Environment); the skill does not infer a version from source.

## app.bicep Structure (mandatory order)

Declare resources in this order (do NOT output this as code — it is only for your reference):

1. Extension: `extension radius` (single, covers all Radius types)
2. Params: `environment`; add a `@secure() param` for each developer-supplied secret value
3. Application resource (`Radius.Core/applications@2025-08-01-preview`) — always exactly one
4. Data / infrastructure resources (databases, caches, message brokers, object storage, AI services)
5. Secret resources (app secrets, schema-required credentials, or runtime bindings for supplied secrets)
6. Container image resources (if building from Dockerfile)
7. Container resources (with image, configuration, secret, and dependency wiring)
8. Routes (only if external ingress needed)

Rules:
- One `Radius.Compute/containers` per deployment unit; its `containers` map must include every co-scheduled role required by that unit. Separate independently deployed services into separate resources. Create one typed resource per selected backing service.
- Building from a complete Dockerfile context: add a `Radius.Compute/containerImages` resource with `build.source` set to the repo git URL (`git::https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git//<subdir>?ref=<sha-or-tag>`); the container references the built image via `<serviceName>Image.properties.imageReference` (no separate connection needed).
- Database credentials follow the type's schema: if it defines `username`/`password`, set them on the resource; if it defines `secretName`, create a `Radius.Security/secrets` and reference it; if it defines neither, the type takes no credentials. Always use a `@secure() param` for the password.
- Add `Radius.Compute/routes` only for external ingress.
- Keep provider modules, SKUs, regions, firewall/network policy, and recipe output mapping in Environment/provider Bicep. `app.bicep` contains only developer intent and app-facing runtime wiring.

## Connections

`connections` declares a generic Radius relationship. It does not translate resource properties into arbitrary application-specific variable or configuration names. Read [connection-conventions.md](references/connection-conventions.md).

Rules:
- Inspect the source to identify the exact names, casing, value format, defaults, and configuration mechanism it consumes.
- Generic projection can be a `CONNECTION_<NAME>_PROPERTIES` JSON value, individual `CONNECTION_<NAME>_<PROPERTY>` values, or another version-specific shape. Verify the configured extension/runtime contract; do not assume one format.
- Use a connection alone only when the application explicitly consumes that applicable generic contract. Otherwise map each required native input explicitly from a verified nonsecret resource output, a secret reference, a literal/default, or runtime composition.
- A direct resource property or secret reference creates dependency ordering. Do not add a connection merely for ordering; retain one only when the application/tooling consumes the relationship.
- An explicit request for Radius relationship metadata is a valid reason to retain a connection. Use the exact requested connection key and `source`; explicit native wiring may still be required for the workload.
- Explicit native variables may coexist with generic projection. Avoid conflicting values, and use `disableDefaultEnvVars` only when the exact container schema supports it and the generic variables would be harmful.

## Secrets

See [secrets-handling.md](references/secrets-handling.md). Secret contracts are version- and type-specific:

- **Inputs** (credentials you supply): follow the exact schema — sensitive resource properties, a referenced `Radius.Security/secrets`, or no credential input. Use `@secure()` for Bicep inputs, but remember it does not automatically protect every downstream `env.value` or interpolated property from state.
- **Outputs** (values a recipe generates): inspect the exact registered schema and recipe output mapping. When they declare managed-secret metadata, bind the workload directly with `secretName: <resource>.properties.secrets.name` and an exact key declared in that block. Those key declarations are not readable convenience properties. Never copy a recipe secret through an authored wrapper or guess `<resource>.properties.<key>`; if the managed-secret contract is absent, report the gap.
- When an application requires a connection string containing a secret, bind the secret as a helper environment variable and compose at runtime with correct ordering and escaping. URL-encode credentials when the target syntax requires it.

## Bicep Structure Rules

Read [bicep-structure-rules.md](references/bicep-structure-rules.md) for all structural rules.

## Validation Checklist

Before returning the Bicep, verify:
- [ ] One deployment profile is selected. Every explicit type, workload role/count, native key, required value, secret binding, and connection name from the request is represented in a closed requirement ledger.
- [ ] Every planned resource property read/write has its verbatim path in the ledger and exists in the exact configured schema/API version. Every recipe-generated output also has a verified output mapping; every managed-secret reference has the declared secret-name path and key. An absent path blocks generation rather than being replaced by a guessed property, alias, or wrapper.
- [ ] Exactly one `Radius.Core/applications@2025-08-01-preview`, and one `extension radius` (no per-namespace or per-type extensions).
- [ ] The file compiles with the target repository's exact configured extension; every `Radius.*` type is on the allow-list and matches that version's schema and API version. Unknown type/property warnings are resolved, not ignored. If only a newly generated floating alias is available and it conflicts with the proven target Environment contract, the exact-contract file is retained, the drift is reported as a validation blocker, and deployability is not claimed until the target extension compiles it.
- [ ] `param environment string` is declared; add a `@secure() param` for each developer-supplied secret.
- [ ] Every required executable role is modeled, including co-scheduled producer/consumer or proxy/backend roles. Its image/build, entrypoint/arguments, listener, exposed ports, config artifacts, writable storage/ownership, and lifecycle are correct. `containerPort` matches the process; it does not configure the listener.
- [ ] Every required app-native input is supplied with the exact pinned-source name, casing, type, URL/config syntax, and value. Each declared generic connection is consumed by source or explicitly required as relationship metadata.
- [ ] A source build has a complete practical Dockerfile/context and uses an immutable ref; otherwise the published image is pinned. Generated builds are consumed through `.properties.imageReference`.
- [ ] Credentials match the type's schema: `username`+`password` on the resource, or `secretName`+secret, or none — whichever the schema defines. Password via `@secure() param`; `database`/`topic`/`queue`/etc. derived from source.
- [ ] Every runtime secret follows the exact schema/recipe contract and reaches the exact native key through `secretKeyRef` where supported. Recipe-generated values bind directly from declared managed-secret metadata; no authored secret copies a resource output or guessed convenience property. A sensitive resource input is not assumed to be readable by the container. No secret is hardcoded or moved into plain state; runtime composition preserves ordering, escaping, and required encoding.
- [ ] Read-only properties are never **set**. A referenced nonsecret output exists in the exact schema and recipe; a referenced secret path/key exists in the exact secret-output contract. Such direct references provide dependency ordering.
- [ ] Every dependency has a complete client tuple: subresource name, endpoint/FQDN transformation, port, protocol/version, TLS mode, auth mechanism/identity, secret source, and final client syntax. Provider modules, SKUs, regions, and firewall configuration remain outside `app.bicep`.
- [ ] Primary-feature readiness is proven: required model aliases, storage backends, database clients, and messaging inputs/outputs are configured and reference the selected resources. A health endpoint or idle/placeholder process is not sufficient.
- [ ] Perform the static consistency pass in [runtime-contract.md](references/runtime-contract.md); no unresolved runtime caveat remains.
- [ ] The generated Bicep contains no explanatory comments. `.radius/bicepconfig.json` resolves the `radius` extension for `app.bicep`: created or updated in place (a parent `bicepconfig.json` is used only as input, never modified).

## Example

See [todo-list-app-example.md](references/todo-list-app-example.md) for source-derived database wiring and [managed-kafka-example.md](references/managed-kafka-example.md) for closing a managed Kafka client tuple without downgrading TLS, authentication, or secret handling.
